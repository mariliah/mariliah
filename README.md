<p>My name is Marilia Henriquez, currently located in Houston, Texas. My journey into tech started in December 2021, when I signed up for Thinkfuk's Software Engineering bootcamp. Upon successful completion, I worked for a start-up as a junior developer, and have since decided to return to university to further my education.<br>

I am currently studying at University of Maryland, majoring in Cybersecurity Technology and Management Information Systems. Currently working as a Software Engineer (backend) intern at DefendEdge.</p>
